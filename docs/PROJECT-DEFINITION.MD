TODO: Implement

## Purpose

This Project Definition Document provides a brief overview of CafeJava to promote a shared understanding of it before a more detailed Plan, Schedule, and Budget is prepared.

## Problem/Opportunity

Problem: Cafe stores have to manually take inventory which wastes time and effort.
Opportunity: Build an automated inventory to keep track of all products, stocks, and transaction history.

## Project Goal

Applying theory-based project management skills to a real world software application.

## Project Objectives

-   Make it easier to keep track of inventory
-   Provide a centralized place for transaction histories
-   Create fast and reliable software
-   Learn project management skills through application
-   Develop high-quality software

## Project Scope

Current scope includes:

-   Keep track of frozen food items.
-   Keep track of ingredients (sugar, syrup, etc).
-   Keep track of transactions (order list, customer information, etc).
-   Implement using command line interface.
-   Provide unit, component, and system testing.
-   Document using javadocs.

Additional (if time permits) scope includes:

-   Keep track of recipes.
-   Set up a reminder system if ingredients run low
-   Develop and deploy website for documentation

## Key Stakeholders

-   Management (Retik)
-   Employees
-   Store management

## Success Criteria

-   A command line interface system.
-   Fully tested, with at least 80% code coverage.
-   Fully documented deliverable.
-   Create a PowerPoint presentation

## Assumptions

-   Customers do not interact with the system directly.
-   Employees and management are given the same permissions.
-   Employees and management are going to use the system in the same way.
-   Developing and deploying will cost no money.

## Constraints

-   Time constraint (5 weeks).
-   Resource constraint (no money).

## Risks

-   Database leak that results in loss of data.
-   Customer interact with the system directly.
-   Transaction history was altered after transaction was finalized.

## Estimated Duration

Final project due: 6/4/18
Final presentation due: 6/5/18

## Recommended Project Approach

It will be a java-based, command line interface. Technologies used are:

-   Static Analysis Tools: FindBugs, PMD
-   Coding Style Standard: Google Standard
-   Enforce Coding Style: CheckStyle
-   Build Automation: Gradle
-   Continuous Integration: Travis CI
-   Test Automation: JUnit
-   Test Development: Agile with Test-Driven Development (TDD)
-   IDE: IntelliJ
